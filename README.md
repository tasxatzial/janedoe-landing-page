# Jane Doe landing page

A simple portfolio landing page for an imaginary person.

This project is part of the [Build and Deploy Your Portfolio](https://scrimba.com/learn/portfolio) course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).

## Implementation

* Responsive.
* Accessible + screen reader friendly.
* Open and close navigation icons are created with CSS only.
* Mobile first approach.

While my implementation follows the course content loosely, it isn't an exact match of the design or the implementation shown in the course. I've made some intentional changes, with the aim of improving upon the provided design. Here's a non-exhaustive list:

* Contrast issues have been fixed.
* Accessibility features have been added/fixed.
* When the mobile nav menu is open, it's no longer possible to use the tab key to navigate to focusable elements outside the menu.
* The site now has a max width to avoid issues with elements positioned too far to the left or right. Paragraphs also have a max width to avoid issues with very long lines.
* The animation of the hamburger icon during the toggling of the mobile nav menu was too complicated and has now been simplified. Also, its size has been increased to make it easier to click.
* The 'my work' section now has a max width and has been redesigned to make it more accessible.
