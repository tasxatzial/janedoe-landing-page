# Jane Doe landing page

A simple portfolio landing page for an imaginary person.

This project is part of a course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com). [Design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/6ebfeb86-6eeb-4b69-77dc-ecf4c4506bcc-188e/) and starter files are provided by [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell).

## Implementation

* Responsive (grid + flexbox).
* aria-* atrributes for assistive technology.
